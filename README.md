# Browser Storage Manager

A powerful browser extension for developers and privacy-conscious users to manage, analyze, and clean browser storage data.

## Quick Start

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```bash

## Development

### Icon Management
The extension includes both SVG source files and PNG files for icons:
- `public/icons/*.svg` - Source files that can be modified
- `public/icons/*.png` - Generated files used by the extension

If you modify any SVG files, regenerate the PNGs:
```bash
npm run convert-icons
```

### Development Commands

- `npm run build` - Build the extension
- `npm run preview` - Preview the build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code quality
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests with Vitest
- `npm run convert-icons` - Convert SVG icons to PNG

### Extension Features

#### üß≠ Storage Dashboard
- Visualize total browser storage usage
- Identify the largest domains consuming space
- Intuitive cards for each domain showing storage breakdown

#### üîç Domain-Level Insights
- Detailed view for each domain showing:
  - History entries
  - Cache size
  - Cookie data
  - Local storage usage
- Page-specific breakdowns within each domain

#### üìä Advanced Analytics
- Timeline charts showing storage growth over time (7/30/90 days)
- Storage type distribution visualization

### Background Operation
The extension operates in the background to:
1. Monitor visited sites
2. Track storage usage
3. Automatically clean history based on your settings

The background script is implemented in TypeScript and is compiled as part of the build process. Settings persist even when the browser is closed, and automatic cleaning continues to work in the background.
