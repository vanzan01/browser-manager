# Browser Storage Manager

A powerful browser extension for developers and privacy-conscious users to manage, analyze, and clean browser storage data.

## Repository

Official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/vanzan01/browser-manager](https://github.com/vanzan01/browser-manager)

## Purpose

Originally built to solve a common web development challenge: cleaning test sites between sessions. As developers, we often need pristine environments to test our applications, but manually clearing cookies, cache, and other storage for specific domains is tedious and error-prone.

This extension started as a simple tool but evolved into a comprehensive storage management solution with powerful analytics and selective cleaning capabilities.

  - Cookie data
  - Local storage usage
- Page-specific breakdowns within each domain

### üìä Advanced Analytics

- Storage type distribution visualization
- Customizable filters to sort domains by different metrics:
  - Total storage
  - History size
  - Cache volume
  - Cookie data
  - LocalStorage usage

### üßπ Selective Cleaning Tools
- Clear all data for specific domains
- Clear individual pages within domains
